## Python Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values
- `first_name = "Mohamed" - String`
- `DOB = 99 - Integer`
- `UK_resident = yes or no - Boolean`
- `travel = 15.4 - Float`

```python
# Interact with users by taking user data in - input()
# print("Good Morning, Please Enter Your Name")
# name = input() # took user input and stored in the var called name
# print(name) # then printed the user's name

print("Good Morning, Please Enter Your Full Name") # Get user first_name and last_name
full_name = input()
print("Enter Your DOB") # User DOB
d_o_b = input()
print("Enter Your Course Name") # Course name
course_name = input()
print("Are You a UK resident?") # UK_resident
uk_resident = input()

print(full_name)
print(d_o_b)
print(course_name)
print(uk_resident)
```

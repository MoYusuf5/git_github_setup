# Data Collections
# Lists, Tuples, Dict
# Apply DRY

# Lists
# syntax list_name = ["djwn", "fjnd", "nfeunewn"#]

# shopping_list = ["ketchup", "fanta", "eggs", "bread"]
# # print(shopping_list)
# # print(type(shopping_list))
# shopping_list.append("chicken")# add an item to the list
# # print(shopping_list)
# # print(shopping_list[2]) # prints the specific index number provided
# shopping_list[2] = "ice cream" # replaces
# # print(shopping_list)
# shopping_list.remove("fanta") # removes an item from the list
# print(shopping_list)

# can list have multiple data types
# multiple_type = [1, 2, 3, "one", "ten"]
# print(multiple_type)

# Tuples
# Immuatable - cannot be changed - edited - added
# user_details = DOB - country name - city name
# syntax ("")
# essentials = ("milk", "paracetamol", "drinks")
# print(essentials)
# print(type(essentials))
# # What is the difference between Lists & Tuples
# essentials[0] = "coffee"
# print(essentials) # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
